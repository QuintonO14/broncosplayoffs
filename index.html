<h1 id="title"> Why The Denver Broncos Will Make The Playoffs in 2017</h1>

<div id="defense">
    <h2> The Stellar Denver Defense </h2>
    <p> Since 2015, the Denver Broncos defense has been one of the best in the league. Led by the likes of Von Miller
    and Chris Harris Jr., the Broncos have relied heavily on their defense to win games with a mediocre offense. The Broncos will be playing this year without the leader of Demarcus Ware, but Von Miller will truly step into the leader of the defense this year. The new additions to the defensive line such as Domata Peko, Kyle Peko, and Demarcus Walker should help fill the weakness of the defense. A lot of people point to Wade Phillips' departure as a reason the defense will fall apart, but there is a name in Denver ready to fill the void that most people don't know about: Joe Woods. Joe Woods was the defensive backs coach, promoted to be defensive coordinator. What has been Denver's best asset of the defense the last two seasons? The secondary, as they have been #1 in pass defense for those two seasons. Joe Woods will be carrying the same scheme that Wade Phillips brought in, and he will keep the exact same mentality that our defense needs. Denver's defense will be just as dominant as it has been since the super bowl run season.</p>

<div id="offense">
    <h2> Mike McCoy's Classic Offense </h2>
    <p> Mike McCoy was Denver's offensive coordinator shortly before accepting the head coaching job with the then San Diego Chargers. He's now back with Denver calling plays for the offense once more. In the end, it's not going to matter who's the QB for the Broncos offense because all the other pieces are there for McCoy's scheme. McCoy's offenses average roughly 30 points per game throughout his career. The running game will be by committee with Jamaal Charles, CJ Anderson, and Devonte Booker. Denver still has one of the best WR duos in the league with Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders. But who's playing the slot? This role could be filled by a number of players, in reality. There's Carlos Henderson or Isiah McKenzie, both great draft picks by Denver with incredible speed and hands. Denver could also throw Jordan Taylor into the mix at slot. Regardless who it is, they're complimented well by two of the best receivers in the league in terms of production. The only truly worrying part about McCoy's offense will be on the shoulders of the offensive linemen and if they step into form this year or not. Last year's offensive line was atrocious, this year however Denver could see improvements. The additions of Ronald Leary and Garrett Bolles are really what the offensive line needs to solidify. Matt Paradis is one of the best centers in the league, giving him support will only make his play better. </p>

<div id="headCoach">
    <h2> A New Head Coach...Mr. Vance Joseph </h2>
    <p> Vance Joseph is a Colorado University graduate. He knows the Denver Broncos and what the organization is about. Had Gary Kubiak not come to Denver in 2015, John Elway had Vance Joseph as his second option for the head coaching position. Vance brings a great player's coach mindset to the table. So far the reports out of Denver from players is that they all love coach Joseph. He's going to keep that toughness in the defense and he will even make sure that mentality carries over to the offense, especially the offensive line. Coach Kubs was a great head coach, but at times he was too conservative and the offense got bullied around too much. Vance has walked into the perfect roster for his first head coaching gig. And he knows the expectation is to make it back to the post season. </p>

<div id="conclusion">
    <h2> Conclusion </h2>
    <p> As long as Denver's offensive line doesn't play WORSE than it played last year and the QB under center is even game manager efficient, the Denver Broncos will easily be returning to the playoffs. No other team in the division has as good of a roster in terms of talent that Denver has(Yes that includes Oakland). Considering the Broncos went 9-7 last season with a broken offensive line, injured running backs, shaky QB play, and a head coach with health issues, the only direction the Broncos can go from here is up. They have the necessary pieces to make it back to the post season, it's just up to those pieces to put themselves together. </p>
